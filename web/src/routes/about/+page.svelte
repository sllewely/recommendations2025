		Hey friends! I'm excited to build this overly ambitious social app. I'm a child of the 90s and
		miss the days of social media when it was actually useful to <b>connect</b>
		with the people you knew, instead of being bombarded with suggested content to drive ad revenue.
		I want to make something fun.

	<p>Share <b>recommendations</b> and see what your friends are watching/reading/eating/playing.</p>

		Hey friends! I’m excited to build this social app. I originally envisioned events and
		recommendations as two separate projects – inspired by wanting to go to concerts with friends
		and wishing I could remember that tv show someone recommended to me when I’m bored. But I feel
		there’s this dark gap in the technology we use, as the social media apps we grew up with have
		retreated from connecting us with our friends and family to instead serve us ads, propaganda,
		and addicting content. I want to build something that will help you become more connected with
		the people you know.
	</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<H2>Recommendations</H2>

	<p>
		I want to share what I'm interested in with friends, so that we can talk about or share together
		the books, tv shows, games, etc that we're interested in.
	</p>
	<p>
		I want to see what my friends are into! In this age of abundant new media, it's difficult to
		sift through and find what's meaningful or interesting -- but something becomes more meaningful
		when I have people to talk to about it.
	</p>
	<p>I want to be able to track things that I'm interested in or love.</p>
	<p>A feature request is being able to have something like a "favorites" list</p>
	<p>I'm not planning on building any discovery or recommendation algorithm</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<H2>Events</H2>

	<p>
		I want to broadcast to friends concerts and other events that I'm interested in, so I can see
		who wants to join. I want to see what my friends are interested in and are seeking company for.
	</p>
	<p>Our relationships grow when we spend time together!</p>
	<p>
		A feature request here is being able to broadcast a night I'm free, so I can see who wants to
		join, and then we decide what to do from there!
